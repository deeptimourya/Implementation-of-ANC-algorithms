# Implementation-of-ANC-algorithms
This M.Tech thesis project implements Active Noise Cancellation (ANC) using the Filtered-x Least Mean Squares (FxLMS) algorithm. The system processes real-time audio signals and adapts to varying noise environments. It includes MATLAB simulations, Raspberry Pi using MEMS microphones and headphones, and using Vitis HLS and FPGA tools
